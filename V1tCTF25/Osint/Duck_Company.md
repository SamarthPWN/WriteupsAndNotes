## Writeup:
The challenge provided an image file, which at first glance appeared to show a small carved wooden duck dressed in a Halloween costume. Since the task was to identify the company’s website that sold this item, I began by performing a reverse image search using Google Lens, uploading the provided file to see where else it appeared online. The results immediately pointed to several listings of wooden duck figurines that looked nearly identical, most of which mentioned a company called `DCUK`, also known as `The Original Wooden Duck Company`.  
To verify this, I opened the [official DCUK website](https://www.dcuk.com) and found that they specialize in hand-carved bamboo duck ornaments, many of which are themed for various occasions such as Christmas, Easter and Halloween. Their style perfectly matched the one seen in the challenge image, particularly the Halloween-themed designs like the `Jack O’ Lantern Duckling` and `Halloween Wizard Duck`, confirming that this was indeed the right company. Some other online gift shops such as `Gifts from Handpicked` and `The Gift Experience` were also selling these exact ducks, all sourcing their items from `DCUK`.  
According to the flag format, the correct domain to extract here was simply the company’s main website domain and this way we got the final flag for this challenge.
