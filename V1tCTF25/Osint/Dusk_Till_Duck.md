# Dusk Till Duck

**Description:**  
As the sun sets over a calm lake, a lone duck drifts across the fading light. The scene looks peaceful, but the park hides more than it seems. Can you figure out where this photo was taken before the night falls?

## Writeup:
The challenge provided an image showing a serene sunset over a river, with a lone duck drifting across the water and silhouettes of trees lining the horizon. It looked like a typical landscape photograph, but since the task asked for the location, I started by performing a reverse image search using Google Lens, which led me to a matching photo uploaded on Shutterstock by a random photographer. On the image’s page, the description mentioned that it was taken near the Thames River.  
Initially, I assumed this referred to the River Thames in London, United Kingdom and began searching for parks along that river such as Hyde Park, Richmond Park and others near the Thames. However, nothing seemed to match the background from the challenge image. I then revisited the Shutterstock photographer’s profile and noticed something crucial: several of his other photos were tagged as `River Thames, London, Ontario, Canada`. That immediately made me realize my earlier mistake, as I had misinterpreted the location due to the common name Thames River, which also exists in Canada.  
Correcting my search area, I shifted focus to London, Ontario and began exploring parks located along the Thames River there. After checking multiple parks on Google Maps and comparing their surroundings and river layout with the image, I finally found a perfect visual match at `Ivey Park`. The view of the river, the trees and the angle of the sunset aligned exactly with the challenge image, confirming the correct location.
