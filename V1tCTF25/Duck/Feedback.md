## Given Content:
The Google Form asked standard feedback questions:
- How was the ctf ?
- Would you like to participate again?
- Which category was suck ?
- Which category was gud ?

## Writeup:
This was a basic form submission challenge. I opened the provided Google Form, filled out the feedback fields and submitted it. On successful submission the form responded with a thank you message: `"Thanks for your feedback! We really appreciate your time and hope you enjoyed the CTF."` The challenge was designed to check if participants could find and complete the feedback form; the flag was returned on the submission confirmation.
