# Rules

**Description:** Read the [rules](https://ctf.v1t.site/rules) brother please :<  

## Given Content:
🕹️ CTF Rules (Read or Regret Later)  
1️⃣ Don’t DDoS, Brother 🙏  
Our infra is held together by hopes, dreams, and duct tape. Please don’t nuke it.

2️⃣ No Bruteforcing / Fuzzing Madness  
If your script sends 10,000 requests per second, it’s not “creative testing,” it’s just rude.

3️⃣ Play Fair, Not Flare ⚔️  
Don’t attack other teams or leak flag — it’s a CTF, not a pirate simulation. 🏴‍☠️

4️⃣ Google Is Allowed, ChatGPT Is Allowed, But Common Sense Is Required 🤓  
If your solution involves rm -rf /, please reconsider your life choices.

5️⃣ Have Fun (Or Pretend To) 🎉  
If you’re not having fun, just blame the challenge author — it’s tradition.

## Writeup:
This was a simple information disclosure challenge. The `rules` page itself contained a playful list of rules and at the bottom had the flag embedded in plain sight. There was no exploitation or tooling required, only careful reading of the challenge description and `rules` page.
